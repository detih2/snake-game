Snake Promo turns boring discount codes into mini-games. Customers play classic Snake to unlock promo codes letter by letter. The code appears on the snake's body as they play. Result: 3-5x higher redemption rates, memorable brand experience, happy customers.

## First Comment (как основатель)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We built Snake Promo because traditional promo codes are... boring.

Think about it: you receive "SALE20" in your email, maybe copy it, probably forget it 5 minutes later. The conversion rate? 2-3% at best.

We asked ourselves: what if people had to EARN the promo code?

So we built a simple mechanic: 
1. Customer opens a link
2. They play the classic Snake game (yes, the Nokia 3310 one!)
3. Letters of the promo code appear on the snake's body as they play
4. The longer they play, the more letters they unlock
5. Complete the game = full promo code + dopamine rush

Early tests show 8-12% redemption rate (3-5x higher than traditional codes).

Why it works:
- IKEA effect: we value things we "earned" more
- Nostalgia: everyone knows and loves Snake
- Dopamine: gaming mechanics keep people engaged

Perfect for:
- E-commerce promotions
- Email marketing campaigns
- Event booth engagement
- Subscription trial offers
